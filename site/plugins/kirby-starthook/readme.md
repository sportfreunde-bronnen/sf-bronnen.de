# Kirby Starthook

*Version 0.2*

- You will have access to `$page` directly from your `config.php` file.
- You can pass global data to your templates and snippets.
- You can do redirects on certain conditions.

**[How to install Kirby Starthook](docs/install.md)**

## Usage

Put your starthook code into the `config.php` file or in a plugin.

### Example 1

**Pass global data to templates and snippets**

The data that is returned here can later be used in all your templates and snippets:

```php
c::set('starthook', function($page) {
  return array(
    'foo' => 'my first template variable ' . $page->title(),
    'bar' => 'my second template variable'
  );
});
```

**Note:** This plugin only provides access to the `$page` object, whereas `$site` and `$pages` may be accessed with `site()` and `site()->children()`.

### Example 2

**Redirect on condition**

On a condition, redirect to another page.

```php
c::set('starthook', function($page) {
  if($page->title() == 'Project A') {
    go(page('projects'), 301);
  }
});
```
